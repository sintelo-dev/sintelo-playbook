# Sintelo Playbook

Sintelo helps companies make better decisions about their operating capital.

This repository documents how we approach complex business decisions through
structured analysis and short decision memos. Rather than presenting abstract
frameworks, we show our thinking through concrete cases.

Each case follows a simple decision loop:

- Observe the industry and operating context  
- Orient around how decisions are currently made  
- Decide what operating capital questions matter  
- Act by issuing clear judgment and trade-offs  

The goal is not to optimize models or produce reports, but to improve the
quality, speed, and clarity of operating capital decisions.

## How to read this repository

Cases are documented sequentially using short memos. Each memo represents a
specific stage of the decision process and builds on the previous one.

The first case, *AdventureWorks*, serves as a realistic reference to illustrate
how this approach applies to an operating business with inventory, production,
and capital constraints.

This repository is intended as a working playbook, not a finished methodology.
