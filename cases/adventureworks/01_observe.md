# Observe — Industry and Operating Context

AdventureWorks represents a mid-sized discrete manufacturing business operating
with physical products, multi-stage production, and inventory across raw
materials, work-in-process, and finished goods.

The company’s performance is driven not only by sales and margins, but by how
effectively it deploys operating capital to support production and demand.

## Industry characteristics

Manufacturing businesses like AdventureWorks typically exhibit:

- High inventory intensity relative to revenue
- Capital tied up across procurement, production, and distribution
- Lead times that create gaps between cash outflows and inflows
- Operational constraints that limit short-term flexibility

As a result, decisions made by operations directly shape capital employed, often
before financial outcomes are visible in the P&L.

## Operating model implications

In this context, operating decisions determine:
- How much inventory is required to sustain service levels
- Where capital accumulates across the production flow
- How quickly capital turns back into cash
- Which operational trade-offs are implicitly accepted

Many of these decisions are embedded in daily routines rather than explicitly
evaluated as capital allocation choices.

## Why operating capital matters here

For a manufacturing business, improving performance is not only a question of
increasing EBITDA. It also requires improving how much capital is required to
generate that EBITDA.

Inventory levels, production batch sizes, replenishment policies, and service
targets all influence the amount of capital invested in operations.

Understanding this operating context is a prerequisite for evaluating returns on
invested capital and for identifying where decision quality can be improved.
