# CRISP-DM — Business Understanding

## Decision context

AdventureWorks operates as a discrete manufacturing business with physical
products, multi-stage production, and inventory distributed across raw materials,
work-in-process, and finished goods.

A significant portion of the company’s operating capital is embedded in
inventory decisions that are made operationally rather than explicitly evaluated
as capital allocation choices.

The objective of this analysis is not to optimize inventory levels in isolation,
but to evaluate how inventory-related operating decisions consume capital relative
to the returns they generate.

## Decision question

Which operating inventory decisions at AdventureWorks consume a disproportionate
amount of operating capital without generating proportional returns in service or
revenue?

This question reframes inventory management as a capital deployment problem rather
than a purely operational one.

## Business objectives

- Identify where operating capital is concentrated across inventory categories
- Assess whether capital intensity aligns with observed economic or operating
  benefits
- Distinguish between inventory that supports value creation and inventory that
  merely absorbs capital
- Provide a factual basis for challenging implicit operating assumptions

The objective is decision quality, not model sophistication.

## Success criteria

The analysis is successful if it enables:
- Clear identification of inventory segments with high capital consumption
- Transparent comparison between capital employed and observable returns
- Isolation of operating decisions or policies driving capital intensity
- A defensible basis for a capital-focused decision memo

## Constraints and assumptions

- AdventureWorks is a representative proxy, not a real company
- Data granularity limits the precision of conclusions
- Organizational and behavioral constraints are not modeled

## Out of scope

- Forecasting accuracy improvements
- Advanced demand modeling
- Process-level operational optimization
- Tool or system implementation

## Analytical focus

- Inventory value and composition
- Capital intensity by product, category, or segment
- Relationship between inventory, sales, and throughput
- Indicators of capital productivity rather than operational efficiency
