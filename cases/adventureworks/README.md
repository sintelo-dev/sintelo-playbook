# AdventureWorks — Operating Capital Case

AdventureWorks is a reference manufacturing business commonly used to represent
a mid-sized company with production, inventory, sales, and capital constraints.

In this playbook, AdventureWorks serves as a realistic proxy to document how
Sintelo approaches operating capital decisions in an operating business context.
The goal is not to analyze the dataset itself, but to simulate the type of
decisions faced by management teams in asset-intensive environments.

This case focuses on questions such as:
- How inventory and production decisions impact capital employed
- How operational choices affect returns on invested capital
- Where capital is tied up versus where it generates returns

All analysis and decisions in this case are documented through short, sequential
decision memos. These memos are intended to illustrate judgment, trade-offs, and
decision clarity rather than technical optimization.

AdventureWorks is used strictly as a learning and demonstration vehicle. Any
similarities to real companies are illustrative.
