# Orient — How Operating Decisions Are Made Today

In businesses like AdventureWorks, most operating capital decisions are not made
through formal capital allocation processes. They emerge from day-to-day
operational choices embedded in routines, policies, and targets.

These decisions are often evaluated for efficiency or service impact, but rarely
through their effect on capital employed.

## Where capital decisions actually happen

In a manufacturing environment, operating capital is primarily shaped by:

- Inventory replenishment rules
- Production planning and batch sizing
- Service level and availability targets
- Lead time assumptions across suppliers and operations

Each of these choices determines how much capital is committed before revenue is
realized.

## How decisions are typically evaluated

Operational teams tend to optimize for:
- Service levels
- Throughput
- Utilization
- Schedule stability

Finance teams, on the other hand, monitor outcomes such as:
- Working capital balances
- Cash flow
- Inventory turns

However, the linkage between operational choices and financial outcomes is often
indirect, delayed, or unclear.

## Consequence of this separation

Because operating decisions and financial evaluation are decoupled:

- Capital efficiency is treated as a lagging result, not a design variable
- Inventory growth is justified operationally rather than challenged financially
- Trade-offs between service, flexibility, and capital are rarely made explicit

As a result, significant amounts of capital can remain tied up in operations
without a clear decision owner or explicit rationale.

## Orientation for decision-making

Before proposing any changes, it is necessary to reframe operating choices as
capital decisions.

This orientation shifts the question from:
“Is this operationally efficient?”
to:
“Is this the best use of operating capital given the returns it generates?”

Establishing this perspective sets the foundation for identifying which decisions
truly matter.
